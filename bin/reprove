This script wraps around L<App::Reprove>.

=over

=item C<< --release >>

=item C<< --module >>

=item C<< --author >>

=item C<< --version >>

=back

Positional command-line parameters may be used to set release/module,
version and author.

If this script needs to disambiguate between a release and a module,
it assumes anything containing "::" is a module, and everything else
is a release. A prefix of "::" forces the string to be treated as a
module.
